  "content": "Appendix G: Web Technologies\nG1 Web Server Operations\nHow a web server functions in terms of the client/server architecture. Concepts of virtual hosting and\nweb proxies.\nTraditional Web application\n1. Web server\n2. Database server\nClient send HTTP requests to webserver, server returns a full webpage after pulling and processing data\nfrom static files or database.\nInstall your own server: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html\nFamous Stacks: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl (LAMPP)\nModern Apps and Single Page Applications\nSpits backend and front end.\nFrontend talks to backend via asynchronous javascript HTTP requests. https://developer.mozilla.org/enUS/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests\nA simple view of this is as such. When we get a new PHP page, the browser will request for a totally new\npage, and data has to be passed to the new page.\nSingle Page Applications will switch the whole page within the browser to some other content, without\nhaving to load new page from browser. The new content could be pre-loaded, or taken via javascript\nfrom a backend server to serve the content.\nThe above is a simplistic rundown of webtechnologies. Further reading is\nrequired. https://archive.uneca.org/sites/default/files/uploaded-documents/SROs/SA/GISSP2018/introduction_to_web_technology.pdf https://developer.mozilla.org/enUS/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server\nVirtual Hosting\nTradditionally, websites are hosted on computers within an office environment, where the office owns\nthe physical hardware connected to the internet, and is responsible of hardware maintenance and such.\nVirtual Hosting is where We can \"split\" the computer in a way where we can host multiple websites or\nsubdomains. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting\nWe will likely see this in cheap shared hosting services such as GoDaddy.\nWeb Proxies\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server\nClient -> Proxy Server -> web server\nThe Proxy server sits inbetween the client and the webserver. It can serve functions such as monitoring\nand filtering, firewall, loadbalancing functions etc.\nIn pentesting, we may use proxy servers to simulate some behaviours of the machines to accurately\nretrieve data.\n\nG2 Web Servers and their flaws\nCommon web servers and their fundamental differences and vulnerabilities associated with them: • IIS •\nApache (and variants)\nInternet Information Services (IIS)\nWindows web service. Runs with .asp, .aspx extensions Depends on web.config file\nIf we have unrestricted file upload capabilities, we can upload .asp, .aspx files to run reverse shells or\nother payloads.\nIf Web.config is viewable, there may be some credentials that is there for us to exploit. If we can change\nthe web.config, we may also use it to achieve code execution.\nApache\nOn its own, Vulnerabilities in the servers are usually due to misconfigurations. e.g. HTTP PUT/COPY\nmethods.\nAPACHE is often packaged together with PHP. Most vulnerabilities will be found as application\nvulnerabilities rather than Apache vulnerabilities.\nApache TOMCAT (.jsp)\nHost manager page vulnverabile to WAR file upload. uses .jsp file extension.\nVulnerabilities in the servers are usually due to misconfigurations. e.g. HTTP PUT/COPY methods.\n\nG3 Web Enterprise Architecture\nDesign of tiered architectures. The concepts of logical and physical separation. Differences between\npresentation, application and database layers.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/sg-en/cloud/learn/three-tier-architecture\nEach tier is run on separate infrastructure. Instead of a LAMPP stack on one computer only, we can split\nfrontend, backend, and database into 3 servers.\nPresentation Tier (aka frontend)\nHTML/CSS and JS for communicating with other services.\nApplication Tier\nCommonly using REST, RESTFUL or SOAP APIs, this is the back end where data processing occurs.\nDatabase Tier\nFor storing and retrieving data.\nThe concepts of logical and physical separation.\nA simplistic view is that \"logical\" means by software. For example, the LAMPP stack has all 3 services\nrunning on the same machine.\nA simplistic view is that \"physical\" means by hardware. For example, we have 3 servers running\nfront,back and database layers.\nImplications: Load balancing - The infrastructure is more reliable. if the frontend gets a large number of\nqueries and slows down or crashes, the all 3 services are down.\nOn a multi-tier architecture, if front end is heavy and slow, we may be able to spin up another instance\nof front end to lesson the load, whilst not touching the backend or databases.\nAnother implication is that if the frontend is hacked, the data is \"safe\", as it is elsewhere, granted that\ncredentials are not leaked. This may give incident responders time to react and take action.\nG4 Web Protocols\nWeb protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, SOAP. All HTTP web methods and response codes. HTTP Header Fields\nrelating to security features\nHypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\nRequest-Response model. Browser sends requests -> Server responds with data -> Browser shows data\non screen for users\nHTTP Requests\nHTTP Request Header\nMethods are a way for HTTP to send and receive data, and may have specific functions. Servers may\nfilter request using any of the information here.\nSample request header:\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)\nHost: www.google.com\nAccept-Language: en-us\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nCookie: PHPSession=d2hhdGV2ZXJtYW50aGlzaXNhbWF6aW5nanVzdGFzYW1wbGVjb29raWU=;\nusername:iamhero\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nMethod - GET. / is the path of home page. User-Agent: this is what the browser is using. Can be spoofed.\nServers may filter request using this. Host is the web domain url Cookie is where data is stored for any\nnumber of applications like shopping cart, analytics etc.\nReading: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers\nHTTP Request BODY\nAdd a space after the header to indicate BODY data. This can be where form data is, or any other data\nthat you want to send over to the server.\nHTTP METHODS\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods Extract from Mozzila, Methods\nHTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given\nresource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP\nverbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group\nof them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.\nGET The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should\nonly retrieve data.\nHEAD The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response\nbody.\nPOST The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in\nstate or side effects on the server.\nPUT The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request\npayload.\nDELETE The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.\nCONNECT The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.\nOPTIONS The OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.\nTRACE The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.\nPATCH The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.\nUsage: GET - Static webpages. Just sends HTML data or API data over. Data transmitted over URL\nparameters POST - Usually used with forms. Data is send in Request BODY.\nThere are other methods like COPY.\nDangerous Methods: PUT/COPY - If we can put files, we achieve file upload. And if it is unrestricted file\nupload, it can be an entrypoint into the server.\nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS\nUses Public-Key Cryptography to secure information. Commonly using RSA for crpytography.\nSSL/TLS\nLatest secure TLS uses TLS1.3.\nHeartbleed OpenSSL exploit\nhttps://heartbleed.com/ Leakage of data through HTTPS that use OpenSSL.\nWhat is being leaked?\nEncryption is used to protect secrets that may harm your privacy or security if they leak. In order to\ncoordinate recovery from this bug we have classified the compromised secrets to four categories: 1)\nprimary key material, 2) secondary key material and 3) protected content and 4) collateral.\nWhat versions of the OpenSSL are affected?\nStatus of different versions:\nOpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive) are vulnerable OpenSSL 1.0.1g is NOT vulnerable OpenSSL 1.0.0\nbranch is NOT vulnerable OpenSSL 0.9.8 branch is NOT vulnerable\nIf during your scanning you see OpenSSL 1.0.1x, you may try Hearbleed exploits to see what leaked\ninformation you can find.\n\nSimple Object Access Protoco(SOAP)\nSends messages with XML format. Since it takes XML data, SOAP APIs may be vulnerable to XML external\nentity injection(XXE) attacks. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP\nPOST /InStock HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.org\nContent-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 299\nSOAPAction: \"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\"\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\"\nxmlns:m=\"http://www.example.org\">\n<soap:Header>\n</soap:Header>\n<soap:Body>\n<m:GetStockPrice>\n<m:StockName>T</m:StockName>\n</m:GetStockPrice>\n</soap:Body>\n</soap:Envelope>\nHTTP Response codes\nWhen HTTP server sends a response, it carries a response code that indicates success or failure or an\noperation. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status\nHTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.\nResponses are grouped in five classes:\nInformational responses (100–199) Successful responses (200–299) Redirects (300–399) Client errors\n(400–499) Server errors (500–599)\nCommon response codes: 200 OK. Indicates success and no issues 301 Moved Permanently - perminant\nredirect. i.e. text.com/help redirects to test.com/faq 401 Unauthorized 403 Forbidden 404 Not Found Page not found. 500 Internal Server error 502 Bad Gateway - Likely when server not set up properly.\nRefer to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status for full list and details.\nHTTP Header Fields relating to security features\nhttps://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/web_security Source: https://www.netsparker.com/blog/websecurity/http-security-headers/\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'\nX-Frame-Options: deny\nDeprecated ones\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\nPublic-Key-Pins:\npin-sha256=\"cUPcTAZWKaASuYWhhneDttWpY3oBAkE3h2+soZS7sWs=\";\nmax-age=5184000\nOther useful headers\nExpect-CT: max-age=86400, enforce,\nreport-uri=\"https://example.com/report\"\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nReferrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin\nCache-Control: no-store\nClear-Site-Data: \"*\"\nFeature-Policy: microphone 'none'; camera 'none'\nRefer here for more details https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/http-securityheaders/ https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/web_security#web-security-cheat-sheet\n\nG5 Web Markup Languages\nHypterText Markup Language In popular use now as web GUI language. HTML/CSS/JS\nExtensible Markup Language (XML) Not so polular for use int transmitting data, but we may still find\nservices using it, such as SOAP. Also used as config file storage in web servers, etc.\n\nG6 Web programming Languages\nCommon web programming languages: JSP, ASP, PHP, CGI based Perl and JavaScript.\nLanguage\n\nDesc\n\nJakarta Server Pages (JSP)\n\nUsed in TOMCAT servers. .jsp, .jspx\n\nActive Server Pages(ASP)\n\nCommon in Microsoft .NET frameworks and IIS. .asp,.aspx\n\nPHP: Hypertext\nPreprocessor\n\nCommonly used language.

ReactJS and AngularJS\n\nPython\n\nDjango, Flask frameworks available\n\nRuby\n\nRuby on Rails framework\n\nRust\n\nrocket.rs\n\nC++\n\ntreefrog framework\n\nA language is just a language. Almost all Languages have it's own web support or framework.\nFrontend: HTML/CSS/JS The above list is common for the data processing aspect, and thus for backend.\n\nG7 Web Application Server Vulnerabilities\nVulnerabilities in common application frameworks, servers and technologies: .NET, J2EE, Coldfusion,\nRuby on Rails and AJAX.\nOWASP TOP 10 Web vulnerabilites affects all websites, frameworks and applications. It is better to talk\nabout common web vulnerabilites than the server-specific vulnerabilities.\nNot all servers have \"Common\" vulnerabilities, or rather, the classification of \"common\" is difficult.\nVulnerabilities oftern depends on patch levels, versions, dependencies etc.\nWeb\n\nVulnerabilities\n\n.NET\n\nweb.config exposure is common.\n\nJ2EE\n\nhttps://owasp.org/www-pdfarchive/OWASP_NL_Top_Ten_Web_Application_Vulnerabilities_in_J2EE.pdf. Not\nmany known vulnerabilties as found in ExploitDB. SAP NetWeaver J2EE Engine 7.40\n- SQL Injection\n\nColdfusion\n\nColdFusion 8,9,10 has multiple vulnerabilities such as remote code execution,\nauthentication bypass, cross-site scripting etc.\n\nRuby on\nRails\n\nHas remote code exucution, file disclosures etc.\n\nAJAX\n\nThere isn't a web server called AJAX, but it is for asynchronous communications\nwith backend servers.\n\nG8 Web APIs\nWeb APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play a crucial role in enabling communication and\ninteraction between different software applications. They allow developers to access and use the\nfunctionality of a web service, application, or server. Here, I'll provide an overview of three types of\napplication interfaces: CGI, ISAPI filters, and Apache modules.\n1. CGI (Common Gateway Interface):\n• Description:\n• CGI is one of the earliest and simplest methods for creating dynamic content on the\nweb.\n• It defines a standard for communication between web servers and external programs,\ncalled CGI scripts.\n• How it Works:\n• When a CGI script is requested, the web server executes the script, passing user input to\nit through environment variables and collecting the script's output to send back to the\nclient.\n• Use Cases:\n• CGI is often used for simple web applications and scripts written in languages like Perl,\nPython, or shell scripts.\n2. ISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming Interface) Filters:\n• Description:\n• ISAPI is a Microsoft technology used in Windows-based web servers, particularly\nInternet Information Services (IIS).\n• ISAPI filters are DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) that can be loaded into the IIS process to\nmodify or enhance the behavior of the server.\n• How it Works:\n• ISAPI filters intercept and process HTTP requests and responses before they reach the\nweb application. They can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, or content\nmodification.\n• Use Cases:\n• ISAPI filters are often used for extending the functionality of IIS servers, implementing\ncustom security measures, or integrating with third-party services.\n3. Apache Modules:\n• Description:\n• Apache modules are similar to ISAPI filters but are used in the context of the Apache\nHTTP Server, an open-source web server software.\n• How it Works:\n• Apache modules are dynamically loaded into the server process and can modify various\naspects of the server's behavior, such as handling specific types of requests or\nimplementing custom authentication.\n• Use Cases:\n• Apache modules are widely used for extending the functionality of the Apache server.\nThey can range from security modules to those supporting specific web application\nframeworks.\n\nG9 Web Subcomponents\nWeb architecture sub-components: Thin/Thick web clients, servlets and applets, Active X. Flash\nApplication Testing .Net Thick Clients Java Applets Decompilation of client-side code\n\nThin vs Thick Clients\nhttps://medium.com/@mouna.mallipeddi/thin-client-vs-thick-client-69d90c13d02d Tech/computing\nterm, not a web term. May refer to software or hardware. Thin - barebones device/app that needs\nconnects to external resouces Thick - Self-sufficient, self-contained. e.g. LAMPP stack, where it is all on\none device, and we can launch locally without internet. Also used when there is a need for offline usage.\nServlets\nA servlet is a small Java program that runs within a Web server.\nExecution of Servlets basically involves six basic steps:\nThe clients send the request to the webserver. The web server receives the request. The web server\npasses the request to the corresponding servlet. The servlet processes the request and generates the\nresponse in the form of output. The servlet sends the response back to the webserver. The web server\nsends the response back to the client and the client browser displays it on the screen.\nSource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-java-servlets/\nApplets\nAn applet is a program written in the Java programming language that can be included in an HTML page,\nmuch in the same way an image is included in a page.\nApplet vs Servlet\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-applets-and-servlets/\nApplet\n\nServlet\n\nApplets are used to provide interactive features to web applications\nthat cannot be provided by HTML alone like capture mouse input\netc. Frontend\n\nBackend processing.\nSimilar to PHP, ASP.NET\n\nActiveX\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX Created by Microsoft for Internet Explorer. Still available in\nInternet Explorer 11, but not in the new Microssft Edge.\nProvides frontend media interactions and functionalities, like plugins.\nFlash Application Testing\nFlash has been deprecated and not in used any more. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash The\nFlash Player was deprecated in 2017 and officially discontinued at the end of 2020\nFlash was used to create and display media for web. Famously Flash games were immensely popular for\nits time.\nFlash Application Testing probably will not come up in today's context. If there is, then feel free to\nsearch for it in ExploitDB.\n\n.Net Thick Clients\nhttps://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/thick-client-penetration-testingmethodology\nAuthor's Note: Thin and Thick clients seem to oftern refer to hardware devices. Thin client device does\nnot even have their own OS. Not sure what Thin and Thick would mean in a .Net or web context. The\nCyberark article classifies Multitier Architecture as Thick client.",

      "content": "G8 Web APIs\nWeb APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play a crucial role in enabling communication and\ninteraction between different software applications. They allow developers to access and use the\nfunctionality of a web service, application, or server. Here, I'll provide an overview of three types of\napplication interfaces: CGI, ISAPI filters, and Apache modules.\n1. CGI (Common Gateway Interface):\n• Description:\n• CGI is one of the earliest and simplest methods for creating dynamic content on the\nweb.\n• It defines a standard for communication between web servers and external programs,\ncalled CGI scripts.\n• How it Works:\n• When a CGI script is requested, the web server executes the script, passing user input to\nit through environment variables and collecting the script's output to send back to the\nclient.\n• Use Cases:\n• CGI is often used for simple web applications and scripts written in languages like Perl,\nPython, or shell scripts.\n2. ISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming Interface) Filters:\n• Description:\n• ISAPI is a Microsoft technology used in Windows-based web servers, particularly\nInternet Information Services (IIS).\n• ISAPI filters are DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) that can be loaded into the IIS process to\nmodify or enhance the behavior of the server.\n• How it Works:\n• ISAPI filters intercept and process HTTP requests and responses before they reach the\nweb application. They can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, or content\nmodification.\n• Use Cases:\n• ISAPI filters are often used for extending the functionality of IIS servers, implementing\ncustom security measures, or integrating with third-party services.\n3. Apache Modules:\n• Description:\n• Apache modules are similar to ISAPI filters but are used in the context of the Apache\nHTTP Server, an open-source web server software.\n• How it Works:\n• Apache modules are dynamically loaded into the server process and can modify various\naspects of the server's behavior, such as handling specific types of requests or\nimplementing custom authentication.\n• Use Cases:\n• Apache modules are widely used for extending the functionality of the Apache server.\nThey can range from security modules to those supporting specific web application\nframeworks."

Flash\nApplication Testing .Net Thick Clients Java Applets Decompilation of client-side code\n\nThin vs Thick Clients\nhttps://medium.com/@mouna.mallipeddi/thin-client-vs-thick-client-69d90c13d02d Tech/computing\nterm, not a web term. May refer to software or hardware. Thin - barebones device/app that needs\nconnects to external resouces Thick - Self-sufficient, self-contained. e.g. LAMPP stack, where it is all on\none device, and we can launch locally without internet. Also used when there is a need for offline usage.\nServlets\nA servlet is a small Java program that runs within a Web server.\nExecution of Servlets basically involves six basic steps:\nThe clients send the request to the webserver. The web server receives the request. The web server\npasses the request to the corresponding servlet. The servlet processes the request and generates the\nresponse in the form of output. The servlet sends the response back to the webserver. The web server\nsends the response back to the client and the client browser displays it on the screen.\nSource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-java-servlets/\nApplets\nAn applet is a program written in the Java programming language that can be included in an HTML page,\nmuch in the same way an image is included in a page.\nApplet vs Servlet\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-applets-and-servlets/\nApplet\n\nServlet\n\nApplets are used to provide interactive features to web applications\nthat cannot be provided by HTML alone like capture mouse input\netc. Frontend\n\nBackend processing.\nSimilar to PHP, ASP.NET\n\nActiveX\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX Created by Microsoft for Internet Explorer.
