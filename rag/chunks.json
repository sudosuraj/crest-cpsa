There are two main versions of IP: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet\nProtocol version 6). Additionally, within the suite of Internet Protocols, there are transport layer\nprotocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol), and ICMP\n(Internet Control Message Protocol). It's important to note that other IP protocols exist within the suite,\nbut IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, and ICMP are among the most commonly encountered.\n\n1. IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4): This is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol and is the\nmost widely used. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numerical labels, and they are expressed in dotteddecimal notation (e.g., 192.168.0.1).\n\n2. IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6): IPv6 was developed as a successor to IPv4 due to the\nexhaustion of IPv4 addresses. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address format, providing a vastly larger\naddress space. IPv6 addresses are expressed in hexadecimal notation (e.g.,\n2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).\n\n3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides\nreliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications on devices in a\nnetwork. It establishes a connection before data is exchanged and ensures that the data is\ndelivered accurately and in the correct order.\n\n4. UDP (User Datagram Protocol): UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides a faster, but less\nreliable, way of delivering data. It doesn't establish a connection before sending data and does\nnot guarantee the delivery or order of packets. UDP is commonly used in scenarios where low\nlatency and real-time communication are more critical than reliability, such as in streaming or\nonline gaming applications.",

It is often used by network devices to send error messages\nindicating issues with network connectivity or to diagnose problems such as unreachable hosts.\nPing is an example of a tool that uses ICMP to check if a host is reachable.\n\nOther IP protocols include protocols like IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) for managing\nmulticast group memberships, OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) for routing, and more. The Internet\nProtocol suite is extensive, covering a range of protocols that operate at different layers of the\nnetworking stack to enable communication and data transfer across networks.",

Sniffing tools can capture packets not\nintended for a particular host.\n\n•\n\nARP Spoofing: Protocols like ARP can be exploited for attacks like ARP spoofing, allowing\nattackers to redirect traffic.\n\nARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning or ARP cache poisoning, is a technique used by attackers to\nmanipulate the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) in a network. The goal of ARP spoofing is to associate\nthe attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate network entity (such as a router or\nanother computer) in order to intercept or modify network traffic. Here's a breakdown of how ARP\nspoofing works and some preventive measures:\n\nHow ARP Spoofing Works:\n\nNormal ARP Operation:\nIn a local network, devices use ARP to map IP addresses to MAC addresses. When a device needs to\ncommunicate with another device on the same network, it sends out an ARP request to discover the\nMAC address associated with a particular IP address.\nARP Spoofing Attack Steps:\nStep 1: Discovery\nThe attacker monitors the network to identify IP-MAC address mappings.\nStep 2: ARP Poisoning\nThe attacker sends forged ARP responses to devices on the network, associating the attacker's MAC\naddress with the IP address of a legitimate entity (e.g., the router).\nStep 3: Traffic Diversion\nWith the ARP cache poisoned, traffic meant for the legitimate entity is redirected through the attacker's\nmachine.\nStep 4: Eavesdropping or Modification\nThe attacker can intercept and inspect the traffic or modify it before forwarding it to the intended\nrecipient.\n\n2.

Switched Media:\n\n• Implications:\n\n• MAC Address Spoofing: Security testing should assess the effectiveness of switch\nconfigurations, including the potential for MAC address spoofing.\n\n• MAC address spoofing is a technique in which an attacker changes the Media Access\nControl (MAC) address of their network interface card (NIC) to mimic a different MAC\naddress. This can be done for various malicious purposes, such as bypassing access\ncontrols, impersonating other devices, or conducting man-in-the-middle attacks. Here's\nan overview of MAC address spoofing and some preventive measures:\n\n• How MAC Address Spoofing Works:\n\n• MAC Address Basics:\n\n• A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface for communication\non the physical network.\n\n• Changing MAC Address:\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nAn attacker uses software tools or manually configures their device to use a different\nMAC address than the one assigned by the manufacturer.\nImpersonation:\nBy spoofing a legitimate MAC address, the attacker can impersonate another device on\nthe network.\n\nBypassing MAC Filtering:\nSome networks use MAC address filtering as a security measure. Spoofing allows\nattackers to bypass this protection by appearing as an authorized device.\nMan-in-the-Middle Attacks:\nMAC address spoofing can be part of man-in-the-middle attacks where the attacker\nintercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties.\nVLAN Hopping: Vulnerabilities in switch configurations may allow attackers to hop\nbetween VLANs, potentially gaining unauthorized access.\n\n3.

This type of attack\ntakes advantage of the way VLANs are implemented on a network and can potentially\nlead to unauthorized access to sensitive information. Here's an overview of how VLAN\nhopping works and some preventive measures:\n\nHow VLAN Hopping Works:\n\nDouble Tagging (Double Encapsulation):\nVLAN hopping often involves sending frames with double VLAN tags. The attacker adds\nan extra VLAN tag to the Ethernet frame, making it appear as if the frame belongs to a\ndifferent VLAN.\n\nTrunk Ports Exploitation:\nTrunk ports are used to carry traffic for multiple VLANs. In a misconfigured or insecure\nenvironment, an attacker may gain access to a trunk port and exploit it to send doubletagged frames.\n\nNative VLAN Exploitation:\nSome networks have a native VLAN for untagged traffic on a trunk. Attackers may send\nframes with double tags, exploiting the native VLAN to access frames of a different\nVLAN.\nIn a penetration test, understanding these security implications helps identify potential vulnerabilities\nand weaknesses in the network architecture. It's essential to conduct thorough testing across different\nlayers and components of the network to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of security posture.\n\nB3: Missing from the official CREST CPSA syllabus document",

Each category has three permission types: read (r), write (w), and\nexecute (x).\n\n1. Symbolic Representation:\n\n• r: Read permission\n\n• w: Write permission\n\n• x: Execute permission\n\n• -: No permission\n\n2. Numeric Representation:\n\n• Each permission type is assigned a numeric value: read (4), write (2), execute (1).\n\n• The sum of these values represents the permission level.\n\nExample:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user1 group1 1024 Nov 23 10:00 myfile.txt\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nThe owner (user1) has read and write permissions.\nThe group (group1) has read-only permissions.\nOthers have read-only permissions.\n\nFile System Permissions in Windows:\n\nIn Windows, file system permissions are managed through Access Control Lists (ACLs). Permissions\ninclude Full Control, Modify, Read & Execute, Read, and Write.\n\n1. Full Control:\n\n• Includes all permissions.\n\n2. Modify:\n\n• Allows reading, writing, and deleting files, as well as modifying folder attributes.\n\n3. Read & Execute:\n\n• Allows viewing and running executable files.\n\n4.

It is not in use today, however, we may still see some or its services, such as rlogin, running in\nCTFs or labs.\nCommands\n\n• rlogin - remote login\n\n• rsh - remote shell. This is a server, does not require login.\n\n• rexec - remote execute. This is a server, requires login.\n\n• rcp - remote copy\n\n• rwho - remote who\n\n• rstat - rstat returns performance statistics from the kernel.\n\n• ruptime - shows how long it has been since last restart. If not response, computer marked as\ndown.\nThose r-commands which involve user authentication (rcp, rexec, rlogin, and rsh) share several serious\nsecurity vulnerabilities:\n\n• All information, including passwords, is transmitted unencrypted (making it vulnerable to\ninterception).\n\n• The .rlogin (or .rhosts) file is easy to misuse. They are designed to allow logins without a\npassword, but their reliance on remote usernames, hostnames, and IP addresses is exploitable.\nFor this reason many corporate system administrators prohibit .rhosts files, and actively\nscrutinize their networks for offenders.\n\n• The protocol partly relies on the remote party's rlogin client to provide information honestly,\nincluding source port and source host name. A corrupt client is thus able to forge this and gain\naccess, as the rlogin protocol has no means of authenticating other machines' identities, or\nensuring that the requesting client on a trusted machine is the real rlogin client.",

    "text": "G8 Web APIs\n\nWeb APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play a crucial role in enabling communication and\ninteraction between different software applications. They allow developers to access and use the\nfunctionality of a web service, application, or server. Here, I'll provide an overview of three types of\napplication interfaces: CGI, ISAPI filters, and Apache modules.\n\n1. CGI (Common Gateway Interface):\n\n• Description:\n\n• CGI is one of the earliest and simplest methods for creating dynamic content on the\nweb.\n\n• It defines a standard for communication between web servers and external programs,\ncalled CGI scripts.\n\n• How it Works:\n\n• When a CGI script is requested, the web server executes the script, passing user input to\nit through environment variables and collecting the script's output to send back to the\nclient.\n\n• Use Cases:\n\n• CGI is often used for simple web applications and scripts written in languages like Perl,\nPython, or shell scripts.\n\n2. ISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming Interface) Filters:\n\n• Description:\n\n• ISAPI is a Microsoft technology used in Windows-based web servers, particularly\n\nInternet Information Services (IIS).\n\n• ISAPI filters are DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) that can be loaded into the IIS process to\nmodify or enhance the behavior of the server.\n\n• How it Works:\n\n• ISAPI filters intercept and process HTTP requests and responses before they reach the\nweb application. They can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, or content\nmodification.\n\n• Use Cases:\n\n• ISAPI filters are often used for extending the functionality of IIS servers, implementing\ncustom security measures, or integrating with third-party services.\n\n3. Apache Modules:\n\n• Description:\n\n• Apache modules are similar to ISAPI filters but are used in the context of the Apache\nHTTP Server, an open-source web server software.\n\n• How it Works:",

Thin - barebones device/app that needs\nconnects to external resouces Thick - Self-sufficient, self-contained. e.g. LAMPP stack, where it is all on\none device, and we can launch locally without internet. Also used when there is a need for offline usage.\nServlets\nA servlet is a small Java program that runs within a Web server.\nExecution of Servlets basically involves six basic steps:\nThe clients send the request to the webserver. The web server receives the request. The web server\npasses the request to the corresponding servlet. The servlet processes the request and generates the\nresponse in the form of output. The servlet sends the response back to the webserver. The web server\nsends the response back to the client and the client browser displays it on the screen.\nSource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-java-servlets/\nApplets\nAn applet is a program written in the Java programming language that can be included in an HTML page,\nmuch in the same way an image is included in a page.\nApplet vs Servlet\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-applets-and-servlets/\nApplet\n\nServlet\n\nApplets are used to provide interactive features to web applications\nthat cannot be provided by HTML alone like capture mouse input\netc. Frontend\n\nBackend processing.\nSimilar to PHP, ASP.NET\n\nActiveX\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX Created by Microsoft for Internet Explorer.

It ensures that\nonly authorized parties can access the original data by decrypting it.\nEncoding represents data using a specific format for storage or transmission. Unlike encryption,\nencoding is not intended to keep data secret but rather to ensure that it's properly formatted for a\nparticular system.\n\nSymmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption\n\nSymmetric Encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. This shared secret key must\nbe kept confidential between communicating parties.\n\nAsymmetric Encryption employs a pair of public and private keys for encryption and decryption. The\npublic key is shared openly, while the private key is kept secret. Messages encrypted with the public key\ncan only be decrypted with the corresponding private key.\n\nEncryption Algorithms and Key Sizes\n\n•\n\nSymmetric Encryption\n\n• Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): 128, 192, 256 bits\n\n• Data Encryption Standard (DES): 56 bits (56 effective bits)\n\n• Triple DES (3DES): 112 or 168 bits\n\n• Blowfish: 32 to 448 bits (variable)\n\n• Twofish: 128, 192, or 256 bits\n\n• Serpent: 128, 192, or 256 bits\n\n• ChaCha20: 256 bits\n\n• IDEA\n\n• RC4, RC5, RC6\n\n• CAST\n\n•\n\nAsymmetric Encryption\n\n• Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA): 1024 to 4096 bits\n\n• Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): 160 to 521 bits\n\n• Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: Depends on specific group parameters chosen (e.g., 1024,\n2048, 3072 bits)\n\n• ElGamal: Depends on specific group parameters chosen (e.g., 1024, 2048, 3072 bits)\n\n• DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm): 1024 to 3072 bits",

Allows one switch on a network to\ncentrally manage all VLANs.\nSTP (Spanning Tree Protocol)\nA Layer 2 protocol that is used for routing and prevents network loops by adopting a dynamic routing\nmethod.\nEAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)\nA protocol that enables systems to use hardware-based identifiers, such as fingerprint scanners or smart\ncard readers, for authentication.\n\nnbtstat\nA Windows utility that is used to view and manage NetBIOS name cache information.\n\nGlobal Catalog Server\nA domain controller that holds a subset of the information in all domain partitions for the entire Active\nDirectory forest.\n\nMaster Browser\nPresent on every subnet. Needed for a routed TCP/IP network\n\nFlexible Single Master Operations (FSMO) Roles\nAlso known as operations master roles, these are servers that provide certain functions that can only be\nhandled by one domain controller at a time.\nLANMAN hash\nThe original hash used to store Windows passwords, known as LM hash, based off the DES algorithm.\n(Legacy)\nNTLM Hash\nSuccessor to the LM hash. A more advanced hash used to store Windows passwords, based off the RC4\nalgorithm.\nNTLMv2\nNTLMv2 was developed in response to attacks against the LM authentication protocol. The LM protocol,\nas the name implies, was originally used in the old LAN Manager Network operating system in the mid1980s. It uses the MD5 password hash algorithm.\nOSPF (Open Shortest Path First)\nA link-state routing protocol used on IP networks.\n\nStatic Routing\nAn type of routing used by a network\nadministrator to manually specify the mappings in the routing table.",
